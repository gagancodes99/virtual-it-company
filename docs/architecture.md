# Virtual IT Company Platform - System Architecture

## Overview

The Virtual IT Company Platform is an autonomous AI-powered software development company that operates 24/7, handling multiple client projects simultaneously through intelligent AI agents. This document outlines the technical architecture, system components, and their relationships.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Microservices Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service handles specific responsibilities
- **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failure isolation prevents system-wide outages
- **Technology Agnostic**: Different services can use optimal tech stacks

### 2. Event-Driven Design
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations for better performance
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live project tracking
- **Message Queuing**: Redis for reliable task distribution
- **Workflow Orchestration**: n8n for visual workflow management

### 3. AI-First Approach
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents for different roles
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Intelligent routing between AI providers
- **Cost Optimization**: Smart model selection based on task complexity
- **Continuous Learning**: Self-improving error recovery systems

- **Budget Constraints**: Automatic fallback to cheaper alternatives
- **Specialization**: Code tasks prefer CodeLlama, analysis prefers Claude

```yaml
Model Selection Matrix:
  Simple Tasks (Complexity 1-3):
    Primary: Ollama Mistral (Free)
    Fallback: Claude Haiku ($0.25/1k)
    
  Medium Tasks (Complexity 4-7):
    Primary: Claude Sonnet ($3/1k)
    Fallback: GPT-4o-mini ($0.15/1k)
    
  Complex Tasks (Complexity 8-10):
    Primary: Claude Opus ($15/1k)
    Fallback: GPT-4o ($5/1k)
```
