3. **langgraph-multi-llm-implementation.md** Sections 1-3 - Core architecture (60 min)
4. **unified-autonomous-system.md** - Practical deployment options (30 min)

### Day 2: Implementation
5. **langgraph-multi-llm-implementation.md** Sections 4-6 - Implementation details (90 min)
6. **chat.md** - Advanced features and real examples (60 min)
7. **Cost optimization sections** from all files (30 min)
8. **Deployment scripts** and setup procedures (30 min)

4. Webhook implementations

## Implementation Checkpoints

### After Initial Reading
- [ ] Understand the hybrid architecture approach
- [ ] Know the difference between local vs cloud deployment
- [ ] Grasp the multi-agent orchestration concept
- [ ] Understand cost implications

### Before Starting Development
- [ ] Choose initial SDK (recommend LangGraph)
- [ ] Decide on deployment approach (local/hybrid/cloud)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Configure essential API keys

### During Development
- [ ] Implement core workflow engine first
- [ ] Add agents incrementally
- [ ] Test with single project before scaling
- [ ] Monitor costs from day one

## Reference Guide

### Quick Lookups
- **Architecture Diagrams**: All files contain ASCII diagrams in first sections
- **Code Examples**: unified-autonomous-system.md and langgraph-multi-llm-implementation.md
