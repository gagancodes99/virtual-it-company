## Priority Decision Framework

### When to Promote Priority

Promote P1 â†’ P0 when:
- External dependency requires it
- Customer explicitly requests it
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance critically impacted

Promote P2 â†’ P1 when:
- Multiple customers request feature
- Competitive advantage identified
- Cost savings exceed effort
- Risk mitigation needed

### When to Demote Priority

Demote P0 â†’ P1 when:
- Workaround available
- Can operate without temporarily
- Resource constraints exist
- Dependencies not ready

Demote P1 â†’ P2 when:
- Usage data shows low adoption
- Alternative solution exists
- Complexity exceeds value
- Budget constraints

## Resource Allocation

### Recommended Team Focus

| Week | Priority Focus | Effort Distribution |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | P0 only | 100% on critical path |
| 3-4 | P0 + select P1 | 80% P0, 20% P1 |
| 5-6 | Complete P0, focus P1 | 30% P0, 70% P1 |
| 7-8 | P1 + select P2 | 80% P1, 20% P2 |
| 9+ | P2 + P3 planning | 60% P2, 40% planning |

### Risk-Based Prioritization

**High Risk P0 Tasks** (Do First):
- AI-001 to AI-005: Without these, nothing works
- AGENT-001 to AGENT-002: Core functionality
- WF-003 to WF-004: Complex integration

**Medium Risk P1 Tasks** (Plan Carefully):
- RT-001 to RT-005: Can be mocked initially
- INT-002 to INT-004: Have manual fallbacks
- TEST-001 to TEST-004: Can be iterative

**Low Risk P2/P3 Tasks** (Defer):
- All advanced features
- Scaling beyond 10 projects
- Enterprise features
